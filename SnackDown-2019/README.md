### Q1- Qualifying to Pre-elimination  
Today the organizers ask you to count the number of qualified teams in Pre-elimination round.   
They provide you scores of each team and ensure that all teams scoring at least equal to K-th team.  
**Input:**  
- The first line contains one integer T - the number of testcases. The next 2⋅T lines contains test cases.  
- The first line of each test case contains two integers - N and K.  
- The second line contains N space-separated integers Si, i-th of them denoting the score of i-th team. 
  
**Output:**
For each testcase, output in a single line containing the answer to the problem.  
**Constraints**  
1≤T≤1000    
1≤K≤N≤10^5  
1≤S[i]≤10^9   
sum of N over all test-cases doesn't exceed 10^6
